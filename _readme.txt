A simple test Java console application for the JVoIP SIP library.

Files:
-JVoIP.jar: not included here! Make sure to copy near your java files or add it to your project!
-JVoIPTestPackage.JVoIPTest.java: contains the main example class (with the app entry point) and an example about how to initialize JVoIP and make a call
-SIPNotification.java: helper class to handle the notifications from JVoIP
-SIPNotificationUDP.java: use this only if you wish to receive the notification on UDP instead of using API_GetNotifications polling
-ring.wav: optional ring tone file if you wish to enable local ringback (recommended). Copy this file near your app or JVoIP.jar.
-Mediaench native libraries: optional but recommended for more features and better voice quality: https://www.mizu-voip.com/Portals/0/Files/mediaench.zip
 Unpack and copy the files to your app folder near your java or JVoIP.jar file.
